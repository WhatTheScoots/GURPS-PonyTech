# GURPS-PonyTech
In this Repository you will find a library, that can be used with the software "GURPS Character Sheet" (GCS) https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs 
to create PonyTech characters and equip them with various abilities such as the "Special Pilot Advantages" (SPA) that correspond with MegaMek https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek.

# Sources and inspiration
The race templates and SPA's are based on this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PRJnxEfk2Tik5lfqawLL5RHMjRmph3cRiGSMXBuy-3k/edit.
Some calculation mistakes, when it comes to point values or disadvantages not existing in 4th edition GURPS (Low Manual Dexterity is therefore replaced by Ham-Fisted in the base pony template for example), have been corrected.

# Content

1. Race Templates
